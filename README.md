### **What's Conway's Game of Life?**
The Game of Life is a `Cellular Automaton` (a mathematical and computational model that evolves over time by applying a basic set of rules).
It consists of a regular grid made of cells. Each of those cells can be in one of two states: Dead or Alive. 
The complete set of cells is called a `Generation`. 
Each generation, the model determines the state of the cell for the next generation, 
by checking the state of all their `Neighbors cells` (8 in total, including the diagonals) and applying the following rules according to the 
number of alive neighbors and the current state of the cell:
<br>
- **Survival:** If the Cell is `Alive`, and has two or three `Alive` neighbors, it will be `Alive` in the next generation.
- **Overpopulation:** If the Cell is `Alive` but has more than three `Alive` neighbors, it will be `Dead` in the next generation.
- **Isolation:** If the Cell is `Alive` but has less than two `Alive` neighbors, it will be `Dead` in the next generation.
- **Birth:** If the Cell is `Dead`, but has exactly three neighbors `Alive`, it will be `Alive` in the next generation.

### **Basic Patterns and cell configurations**
After all the chaos generated by the randomized initial position, the simulation stabilizes over time, 
thanks to some basic patterns and structures that are both stable and consistent:

- **Still life:** The cell configuration allows them to remain in the current state indefinitely; 
none of the cells switch states in the next generation, as long as they are not forced by external cells.

- **Oscillatory life:** the cell structure switches between a handful 
of configurations in a cycle that repeats itself indefinitely, as long as they are not interrupted by external cells.

- **Spaceships** The cell structure is oscillatory, but the way it cycles through the different configurations allows 
it to move around the grid indefinitely, until it encounters another group of cells that interrupts the cycle, 
or the simulation border, where some of them will become still lives or oscillatory lives.

> **The project uses the JavaFX sdk v25.0.1**

### **JVM and project's configurations needed (Intellij IDEA):** 

``` java
--module-path "$JAVAFX_HOME$\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml --enable-native-access=javafx.graphics
```

`$JAVAFX_HOME$`: Environment variable that contains the path to the javafx home directory. 
It has to be added to the IDE environment variables.

``` java
JAVAFX_HOME=C:\Java\javafx-sdk-25.0.1
```
